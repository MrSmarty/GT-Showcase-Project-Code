    <h1>Remote Waterscape Manager</h1>

      <h3>Synopsis:</h3>
      <p>
        My family had a problem, we were planning on adding a waterscape to our house with waterfalls, lights, and a few other features. The only problem, was that it would be hard to control this stuff when we were not home.
        I decided to solve this problem, and complete my GT showcase project at the same time. If you have any questions about my project, feel free to ask me. Thank you!
      </p>
      <p>
        For my project, I created a system to control the lights, waterfalls,
        and other features of a waterscape we will be constructing at my house.
        The system is controlled remotely and can be accessed from anywhere with
        an internet connection. For the purpose of this demonstration, I have
        constructed a small demo scene consisting of the Phillips-Hue lights,
        and a few LEDs to demonstrate turning on and off the waterfalls.

      <h3 class="collapsible">How it Works (Simplified):</h3>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          The Raspberry Pi is a tiny computer that is connected to the internet.
          It hosts a small website that waits for an input from a user. When it
          recieves an input, it sends it back to the Pi. The Raspberry Pi then
          decodes the input and figures out what to do with it. The Pi will then
          tell the various components what to do and they will do it.
        </p>

      <h3 class="collapsible">How it Works:</h3>
      <div class="content">
        <h4>Backstory:</h4>
        <p>
          The Raspberry Pi is a 64-bit quad-core computer notable for being the
          size of a credit card, yet having the capabilities to power dual 4K
          displays and run your standard office apps. Running a custom version
          of Linux (Pi OS), the Raspberry Pi is commonly used in the DIY tech
          industry as a server machine or an automator due to its small
          form-factor and easy access to GPIO pins. When I first thought of this
          project, my mind went straight to a Pi, and it worked perfectly.
        </p>
        <h4>The Server:</h4>
        <p>
          The Web server is hosted via Node.JS using the <i>http</i> package.
          When the program runs, the app creates a web server hosted at port
          <hide title="Redacted">8006</hide>. The server serves up an HTML page
          that is read using the <i>fs</i> package. Sadly, I could not figure
          out how to also serve a CSS and JavaScript file alongside the HTML
          file without hosting another server so I used inline code for the CSS
          and JavaScript. The server reads and stores all the data in a JSON
          file so that the system can be shut off and turned back on with no
          loss of data.
        </p>
        <h4>Recieving the Data</h4>
        <p>
          When the client (Website) sends the data back to the Pi, it is split
          up into two different groups; Hardware and Software. The data is
          deciphered and sent to be stored in the JSON file. To store the data,
          the Pi first sets all the values to false in the JSON file. Then it
          takes the string (I opted for a string instead of binary or ints to
          improve readability) and splits it into little bits based on a
          delimiter. Here's a sample line of data: <br />
          <span class="code">
            Formdata: path|#<span style="color: #8f2d2d">8f2d2d</span
            >|true|waterfallOne|true|firepit|#<span style="color: #4f4f4f"
              >4f4f4f</span
            >|false
          </span>
          <br />
          (I have set the color of the Hexadecimal numbers to the color they
          represent. If you would like to learn more about Hexadecimal, click
          here:
          <a class="link" href="definitions.html#hexadecimal">Definitions</a>).
          For the hardware controls, all that is required is a simple on or off,
          and you can see that because they are not followed by a Hexadecimal
          Number.
        </p>
        <h4>Controlling the Hardware</h4>
        <p>
          Connected to the Raspberry Pi is a relay board. The board I used has
          16 modules allowing me to control the power to 16 seperate systems.
          The board is connected to the Pi with GPIO pins, with each pin
          corresponding to a module. When one of the pins recieves power, it
          opens a latch allowing power through the module. This allows me to
          control the water pumps remotely.
        </p>
        <h4>Controlling the Lights</h4>
        <p>
          Controlling the lights is a bit more complex. I used the Phillips-Hue
          Lighting system as a basis for the lights for my project. To control
          them, I send a PUT request to the IP of the bridge with all the states
          I want to set (on/off, color, etc.). To specify which light, they are
          all assigned an ID. In order to control entire areas or groups of
          lights, I have defined lists containing all the Ids of the lights in
          the areas.

      <h3 class="collapsible">Pros and Cons</h3>
      <div class="content">
        <h4>Benefits to This System</h4>
        <p>
          The main benefit to using this system is the customization. A limiting
          factor of the built-in app when using these lights is that each bulb
          can only be in a single "room". This works great, but we plan on using
          these lights outside where they may overlap, eg. a green path that
          runs through a blue section. We want to be able to keep the section
          blue when the path isn't on, but then switch it to green when the path
          is on. This system will handle it all automatically. This also allows
          for scalibility. The base system can only have around 100 lights or so
          before it breaks. By using code, I can connect a second bridge to
          double the light capacity if required. Another benefit is that the
          controls for everything will all be in one place, making it simpler to
          control everything at once. The last advantage is synchronization.
          Because I can control everything from one place, I can synchronize the
          various parts together to create light shows or animation/effects.
        </p>
        <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
        <p>
          The biggest disadvantage is that there is a slightly smaller range of
          colors, but if you need something that isn't on the picker, I'll have
          a custom input option or you could use the app.

      <h3 class="collapsible">Conclusion</h3>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          This project was a very fun experience and I'm glad I did it. I
          learned a lot of new things that I can hopefully apply later on. I was
          faced with many challenges such as learning to communicate with
          servers, creating visually appealing UI, and bypassing the school's
          firewall to present my project here. There are a few things I would
          change if I had to do it again (or feel like it as I'm updating the
          system), but they are mostly minor such as some formatting. Hopefully,
          I will be able to install this system at my home when we finish
          building our ponds. I don't know what I'm going to add next, but I'm
          sure it will be another challenge.
        </p>
        <p>
          I do, however, know that I don't want to touch this project again for
          a solid week. I've spent countless hours trying to figure this out, and I need a nap. If you have any questions, comments, or
          concerns (or if you just want to say hi) my contact information is on
          the about page. Thank You!
