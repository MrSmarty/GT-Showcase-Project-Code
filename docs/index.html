  <h1>Lincoln's Adventures in Web Servers, Remote Access, and APIs</h1>

    <h3>Synopsis:</h3>
    <p>
      For my projecty, I created a system to control the lights, waterfalls,
      and other features of a waterscape we will be constructing at my house.
      The system is controlled remotely and can be accessed from anywhere with
      an internet connection. For the purpose of this demonstration, I have
      constructed a small demo scene consisting of the Phillips-Hue lights,
      and a few LEDs to demonstrate turning on and off the waterfalls.

    <h3>How it Works (Simplified):</h3>
    <p>
      The Raspberry Pi is a tiny computer that is connected to the internet.
      It hosts a small website that waits for an input from a user. When it
      recieves an input, it sends it back to the Pi. The Raspberry Pi then
      decodes the input and figures out what to do with it. The Pi will then
      tell the various components what to do and they will do it.

    <h3>How it Works:</h3>
    <h4>Backstory:</h4>
    <p>
      The Raspberry Pi is a 64-bit quad-core computer notable for being the
      size of a credit card, yet having the capabilities to power dual 4K
      displays and run your standard office apps. Running a custom version of
      Linux (Pi OS), the Raspberry Pi is commonly used in the DIY tech
      industry as a server machine or an automator due to its small
      form-factor and easy access to GPIO pins. When I first thought of this
      project, my mind went straight to a Pi, and it worked perfectly.
    </p>
    <h4>The Server:</h4>
    <p>
      The Web server is hosted via Node.JS using the <i>http</i> package. When
      the program runs, the app creates a web server hosted at port
      <hide title="Redacted">8006</hide>. The server serves up an HTML page
      that is read using the <i>fs</i> package. Sadly, I could not figure out
      how to also serve a CSS and JavaScript file alongside the HTML file
      without hosting another server so I used inline code for the CSS and
      JavaScript. The server reads and stores all the data in a JSON file so
      that the system can be shut off and turned back on with no loss of data.
