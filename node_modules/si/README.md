Node Si
=========

The goal of this project is to provide a simple module that parses and formats
numbers to be human readable - like:
* "10gb" -> 1e10 
* "4 days 7:30:01.444" -> 372601.444
* "64Kb" -> 65536

This might be especially useful in command line arguments and configuration 
directives where you don't want the user to pass the whole number or use the 
scientific notation.

Usage
-------

Write a simple code, like:

    var si = require('si'),
        number = si.parse(process.argv[2]);
        
    console.log('Your number is: ', 
                    number);
    console.log('The square of it is: ', 
                    si.format(Math.pow(number, 2)));
    console.log('The square root on the other hand is: ', 
                    si.format(Math.pow(number, 0.5)));

Now run it:

    $ node tests/basic.js 1G
    Your number is:  1000000000
    The square of it is:  1E
    The square root on the other hand is:  31.62k

Fairly straightforward I hope.

Time intervals
----------------

As of version 2.0.0 you can use node-si to read time intervals. In 2.0.0 only
"n days hh:mm:dd" format is recognized.

To read it, use something like this:

    var hms = require('si').hms, 
        time = si.parse(process.argv.slice(2).join(' '));

    console.log('This program will self destruct in ' + hms.format(time));
    setTimeout(function() { console.log('thanks for waiting...'); }, time);

Should you want to format the time on the other hand:

    var hms = require('si').hms,
        time = +process.argv[2];

    console.log('This program will self destruct in ' + hms.format(time));
    setTimeout(function() { console.log('thanks for waiting...'); }, time);

More implementations will follow (see "Future").

Binary vs. decimal prefixes
-----------------------------

You may use either decimal or binary prefixing:

	var si = require('si'), 
		binNum = 8 << 20,
		decNum = 8e6;
		
	console.log(si.si.format(binNum) + 'bytes vs. ' + si.bin.format(binNum) + 'bytes'); 
	// will output: 8.338Mbytes vs. 8Mbytes

	console.log(si.si.format(decNum) + 'bytes vs. ' + si.bin.format(decNum) + 'bytes'); 
	// will output: 8Mbytes vs. 7.629Mbytes

This might be quite handy for reading command line numbers like bitrate or byte offsets in files.

Future
--------

I will be bringing some more parsers/formatters in later releases, like:

Numbers:
* IEC compliant binary multipliers like "MiB"
* Case sensitive Mbytes/mbytes (decimal vs. binary)
* Fractional SI multipliers like centi/mili etc.

Time:
* ISO 8601 time intervals (P1Y2M10DT2H30M/2008-05-11T15:30:00Z)
* Reading days and months

Feel free to post feature requests in issues. :)
